package com.hexagonstar.tween.easing
{
	/**
	 * Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values, but SteppedEase provides
	 * an easy way to define a specific number of steps that the transition should take. For example, if mc.x is 0 and you 
	 * want to tween it to 100 with 5 steps (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100) over the course of 2 seconds, you'd do:<br /><br /><code>
	 * 
	 * TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:100, ease:SteppedEase.create(5)});<br /><br /></code>
	 * 
	 * <b>EXAMPLE CODE</b><br /><br /><code>
	 * import com.greensock.TweenLite;<br />
	 * import com.greensock.easing.SteppedEase;<br /><br />
	 * 
	 * TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:100, ease:SteppedEase.create(5)});<br /><br />
	 * 
	 * // or create an instance directly<br />
	 * var steppedEase:SteppedEase = new SteppedEase(5);<br />
	 * TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {y:300, ease:steppedEase.ease});
	 * </code><br /><br />
	 * 
	 * Note: SteppedEase is optimized for use with the GreenSock tweenining platform, so it isn't intended to be used with other engines. 
	 * Specifically, its easing equation always returns values between 0 and 1.<br /><br />
