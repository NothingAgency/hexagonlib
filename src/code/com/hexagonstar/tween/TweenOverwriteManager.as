	/**
	 * OverwriteManager resolves conflicts between tweens and controls if (and how)
	 * existing tweens of the same target are overwritten. Think of it as a referee or
	 * traffic cop for tweens. For example, let's say you have a button with
	 * <code>ROLL_OVER</code> and <code>ROLL_OUT</code> handlers that tween an object's
	 * alpha and the user rolls their mouse over/out/over/out quickly. Most likely, you'd
	 * want each new tween to overwrite the other immediately so that you don't end up
	 * with multiple tweens vying for control of the alpha property. That describes the
	 * <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> mode which is the default mode of Tween when it is
	 * not used in conjunction with TweenPro, Timeline, or TimelinePro. This keeps
	 * things small and fast. However, it isn't ideal for setting up sequences because as
	 * soon as you create subsequent tweens of the same target in the sequence, the
	 * previous one gets overwritten. And what if you have a tween that is controling 3
	 * properties and then you create another tween that only controls one of those
	 * properties? You may want the first tween to continue tweening the other 2
	 * (non-overlapping) properties. This describes the <code>AUTO</code> mode which is
	 * the default whenever TweenPro, Timeline, or TimelinePro is used in your swf.
	 * OverwriteManager offers quite a few other modes to choose from in fact:
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><b> NONE (0):</b>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>When:</b> Never</li>
	 * <li><b>Finds:</b> Nothing</li>
	 * <li><b>Kills:</b> Nothing</li>
	 * <li><b>Performance:</b> Excellent</li>
	 * <li><b>Good for:</b> When you know that your tweens won't conflict and you want
	 * maximum speed.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * </li>
	 * 
	 * <li><b> ALL_IMMEDIATE (1):</b>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>When:</b> Immediately when the tween is created.</li>
	 * <li><b>Finds:</b> All tweens of the same target (regardless of timing or
	 * overlapping properties).</li>
	 * <li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
	 * <li><b>Performance:</b> Excellent</li>
	 * <li><b>Good for:</b> When you want the tween to take priority over all other tweens
	 * of the same target, like on button rollovers/rollouts. However, this mode is bad
	 * for setting up sequences.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * This is the default mode for Tween unless TweenPro, Timeline, or
	 * TimelinePro are used in the SWF (in which case <code>AUTO</code> is the default
	 * mode).</li>
	 * 
	 * <li><b> AUTO (2):</b>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can
	 * <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it to re-init and run its overwriting
	 * routine again next time it renders)</li>
	 * <li><b>Finds:</b> Only tweens of the same target that are active (running). Tweens
	 * that haven't started yet are immune.</li>
	 * <li><b>Kills:</b> Only individual overlapping tweening properties. If all tweening
	 * properties have been overwritten, the entire tween will be killed as well.</li>
	 * <li><b>Performance:</b> Very good when there aren't many overlapping tweens; fair
	 * when there are.</li>
	 * <li><b>Good for:</b> Virtually all situations. This mode does the best job overall
	 * of handling overwriting in an intuitive way and is excellent for sequencing.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * This is the default mode when TweenPro, Timeline, or TimelinePro is used in
	 * your swf (those classes automatically init() OverwriteManager in <code>AUTO</code>
	 * mode unless you have already initted OverwriteManager manually).</li>
	 * 
	 * <li><b> CONCURRENT (3):</b>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can
	 * <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it to re-init and run its overwriting
	 * routine again next time it renders)</li>
	 * <li><b>Finds:</b> Only tweens of the same target that are active (running). Tweens
	 * that haven't started yet are immune.</li>
	 * <li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
	 * <li><b>Performance:</b> Very good</li>
	 * <li><b>Good for:</b> When you want the target object to only be controled by one
	 * tween at a time. Good for sequencing although AUTO mode is typically better because
	 * it will only kill individual overlapping properties instead of entire tweens.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * </li>
	 * 
	 * <li><b> ALL_ONSTART (4):</b>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can
	 * <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it to re-init and run its overwriting
	 * routine again next time it renders)</li>
	 * <li><b>Finds:</b> All tweens of the same target (regardless of timing or
	 * overlapping properties).</li>
	 * <li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
	 * <li><b>Performance:</b> Very good</li>
	 * <li><b>Good for:</b> When you want a tween to take priority and wipe out all other
	 * tweens of the same target even if they start later. This mode is rarely used.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * </li>
	 * 
	 * <li><b> PREEXISTING (5):</b>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can
	 * <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it to re-init and run its overwriting
	 * routine again next time it renders)</li>
	 * <li><b>Finds:</b> Only the tweens of the same target that were created before this
	 * tween was created (regardless of timing or overlapping properties). Virtually
	 * identical to <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> except that <code>PREEXISTING</code>
	 * doesn't run its overwriting routines until it renders for the first time, meaning
	 * that if it has a delay, other tweens won't be overwritten until the delay expires.</li>
	 * <li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
	 * <li><b>Performance:</b> Very good</li>
	 * <li><b>Good for:</b> When the order in which your code runs plays a critical role,
	 * like when tweens that you create later should always take precidence over
	 * previously created ones regardless of when they're scheduled to run. If
	 * <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> is great except that you want to wait on overwriting
	 * until the tween begins, <code>PREEXISTING</code> is perfect.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * With the exception of <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> (which performs overwriting
	 * immediatly when the tween is created), all overwriting occurs when a tween renders
	 * for the first time. So if your tween has a delay of 1 second, it will not overwrite
	 * any tweens until that point. <br />
	 * <br />
	 * 
	 * You can define a default overwriting mode for all tweens using the
	 * <code>OverwriteManager.init()</code> method, like:<br />
	 * <br />
	 * <code>
	 * 
	 * OverwriteManager.init(OverwriteManager.AUTO);<br /><br /></code>
	 * 
	 * If you want to override the default mode in a particular tween, just use the
	 * <code>overwrite</code> special property. You can use the static constant or the
	 * corresponding number. The following two lines produce the same results:<br />
	 * <br
	 * />
	 * <code>
	 * 
	 * TweenPro.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:OverwriteManager.PREXISTING});<br />
	 * TweenPro.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:5});<br /><br /></code>
	 * 
	 * OverwriteManager is a separate, optional class for Tween primarily because of
	 * file size concerns. Without initting OverwriteManager, Tween can only recognize
	 * modes 0 and 1 (<code>NONE</code> and <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code>). However,
	 * TweenPro, Timeline, and TimelinePro automatically init() OverwriteManager in
	 * <code>AUTO</code> mode unless you have already initted OverwriteManager manually.
	 * You do not need to take any additional steps to use AUTO mode if you're using any
	 * of those classes somewhere in your project. Keep in mind too that setting the
	 * default OverwriteManager mode will affect Tween and TweenPro tweens.<br />
	 * <br
	 * />
	 * 
	 * 
	 * <b>EXAMPLES:</b><br />
	 * <br />
	 * 
	 * To start OverwriteManager in <code>AUTO</code> mode (the default) and then do a
	 * simple Tween tween, simply do:<br />
	 * <br />
	 * <code>
	 * 
	 * import com.greensock.OverwriteManager;<br /> import com.greensock.Tween;<br
	 * /><br />
	 * 
	 * OverwriteManager.init(OverwriteManager.AUTO);<br /> Tween.to(mc, 2,
	 * {x:300});<br /><br /></code>
	 * 
	 * You can also define overwrite behavior in individual tweens, like so:<br />
	 * <br
	 * />
	 * <code>
	 * 
	 * import com.greensock.OverwriteManager;<br /> import com.greensock.Tween;<br
	 * /><br />
	 * 
	 * OverwriteManager.init(2);<br /> Tween.to(mc, 2, {x:"300", y:"100"});<br />
	 * Tween.to(mc, 1, {alpha:0.5, overwrite:1}); // or use the constant
	 * OverwriteManager.ALL_IMMEDIATE<br /> Tween.to(mc, 3, {x:200, rotation:30,
	 * overwrite:2}); // or use the constant OverwriteManager.AUTO<br /><br /></code>
	 * 
	 * 
	 * OverwriteManager's mode can be changed anytime after init() is called, like.<br
	 * />
	 * <br />
	 * <code>
	 * 
	 * OverwriteManager.mode = OverwriteManager.CONCURRENT;<br /><br /></code>
