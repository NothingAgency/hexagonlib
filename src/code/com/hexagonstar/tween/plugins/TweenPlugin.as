	/**
	 * TweenPlugin is the base class for all TweenLite/TweenMax plugins. <br />
	 * <br />
	 * 
	 * <b>USAGE:</b><br />
	 * 
	 * To create your own plugin, extend TweenPlugin and override whichever methods you
	 * need. Typically, you only need to override onInitTween() and the changeFactor
	 * setter. I'd recommend looking at a simple plugin like FramePlugin or ScalePlugin
	 * and using it as a template of sorts. There are a few key concepts to keep in mind:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>In the constructor, set this.propName to whatever special property you want
	 * your plugin to handle.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>When a tween that uses your plugin initializes its tween values (normally when
	 * it starts), a new instance of your plugin will be created and the onInitTween()
	 * method will be called. That's where you'll want to store any initial values and
	 * prepare for the tween. onInitTween() should return a Boolean value that essentially
	 * indicates whether or not the plugin initted successfully. If you return false,
	 * TweenLite/Max will just use a normal tween for the value, ignoring the plugin for
	 * that particular tween.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>The changeFactor setter will be updated on every frame during the course of the
	 * tween with a multiplier that describes the amount of change based on how far along
	 * the tween is and the ease applied. It will be zero at the beginning of the tween
	 * and 1 at the end, but inbetween it could be any value based on the ease applied
	 * (for example, an Elastic.easeOut tween would cause the value to shoot past 1 and
	 * back again before the end of the tween). So if the tween uses the Linear.easeNone
	 * easing equation, when it's halfway finished, the changeFactor will be 0.5.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>The overwriteProps is an Array that should contain the properties that your
	 * plugin should overwrite when OverwriteManager's mode is AUTO and a tween of the
	 * same object is created. For example, the autoAlpha plugin controls the "visible"
	 * and "alpha" properties of an object, so if another tween is created that controls
	 * the alpha of the target object, your plugin's killProps() will be called which
	 * should handle killing the "alpha" part of the tween. It is your responsibility to
	 * populate (and depopulate) the overwriteProps Array. Failure to do so properly can
	 * cause odd overwriting behavior.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>Note that there's a "round" property that indicates whether or not values in
	 * your plugin should be rounded to the nearest integer (compatible with TweenMax
	 * only). If you use the _tweens Array, populating it through the addTween() method,
	 * rounding will happen automatically (if necessary) in the updateTweens() method, but
	 * if you don't use addTween() and prefer to manually calculate tween values in your
	 * changeFactor setter, just remember to accommodate the "round" flag if it makes
	 * sense in your plugin.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>If you need to run a block of code when the tween has finished, point the
	 * onComplete property to a method you created inside your plugin.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>If you need to run a function when the tween gets disabled, point the onDisable
	 * property to a method you created inside your plugin. Same for onEnable if you need
	 * to run code when a tween is enabled. (A tween gets disabled when it gets
	 * overwritten or finishes or when its timeline gets disabled)</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>Please use the same naming convention as the rest of the plugins, like
	 * MySpecialPropertyNamePlugin.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>IMPORTANT: The plugin framework is brand new, so there is a chance that it will
	 * change slightly over time and you may need to adjust your custom plugins if the
	 * framework changes. I'll try to minimize the changes, but I'd highly recommend
	 * getting a membership to Club GreenSock to make sure you get update notifications.
	 * See http://blog.greensock.com/club/ for details.</li>
	 * </ol>
