	 * Fits a DisplayObject into a rectangular area with several options for scale and
	 * alignment. This method will return the Matrix required to duplicate the
	 * transformation and can optionally apply this matrix to the DisplayObject.
	 * 
	 * @param displayObject
	 * 
	 *            The DisplayObject that needs to be fitted into the Rectangle.
	 * 
	 * @param rectangle
	 * 
	 *            A Rectangle object representing the space which the DisplayObject should
	 *            fit into.
	 * 
	 * @param fillRect
	 * 
	 *            Whether the DisplayObject should fill the entire Rectangle or just fit
	 *            within it. If true, the DisplayObject will be cropped if its aspect
	 *            ratio differs to that of the target Rectangle.
	 * 
	 * @param alignment
	 * 
	 *            The alignment of the DisplayObject within the target Rectangle. Use a
	 *            constant from the Alignment class.
	 * 
	 * @param applyTransform
	 * 
	 *            Whether to apply the generated transformation matrix to the
	 *            DisplayObject. By setting this to false you can leave the DisplayObject
	 *            as it is but store the returned Matrix for to use either with a
	 *            DisplayObject's transform property or with, for example,
	 *            BitmapData.draw()
