	 * Scales a number from one range of numbers into another range of numbers. Allows
	 * to example for example scale a number in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 into the
	 * range of -1.0 to 1.0.
	 * 
	 * Another approach to scale a number manually is to use the formula:
	 * (Scales number from 0 to 99 to a range of -1 to 1)
	 * 
	 * y = ((x / 99.0) * 2) - 1
	 * 
	 * Divide by 99: This normalizes the range from [0, 99] to [0, 1].
	 * Multiply by 2: This increases the range to [0, 2].
	 * Subtract 1: This is a translation which gives [-1, 1].
	 * 
	 * @param value The value to scale.
	 * @param s1 Start of source range.
	 * @param s2 End of source range.
	 * @param d1 Start of destination range.
	 * @param d2 End of destination range.
	 * 
	 * @return The scaled number.
